## 🎯 Overview

This project demonstrates an **interactive 3D hand-tracking environment** using a **standard webcam**, built with **Python (cvzone, OpenCV, MediaPipe)** and **Unity 3D**. Hand gestures captured through a webcam are transmitted via **UDP** to Unity in real-time to animate a 3D hand model.

> ✅ No depth camera required – just a normal webcam!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Tool      | Purpose                            |
|-----------|------------------------------------|
| 🐍 Python | Hand tracking & UDP data sending   |
| 🎮 Unity  | 3D rendering and interaction        |
| 📦 cvzone | Simplified OpenCV + MediaPipe      |
| 🌐 UDP    | Communication between Python & Unity |
| 🎨 C#     | Logic for 3D hand movement & lines |

## 📸 Features

- Real-time **3D hand landmark tracking**
- 21 key points rendered as spheres
- Skeletal lines connecting key points
- Unity integration with UDP for seamless communication
- Easy visualization of hand gestures in 3D space

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🔹 Python Side
- Captures webcam feed
- Detects hand landmarks (21 points)
- Converts coordinates to Unity-friendly format
- Sends data via UDP to Unity

### 🔹 Unity Side
- Receives data through a `udpReceive` script
- Updates 21 `Sphere` objects to match landmark positions
- Draws lines between key points to mimic the hand skeleton
- Visualizes movement in a 3D scene

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Python Setup

```bash
pip install cvzone mediapipe opencv-python
````

Run the script:

```bash
python hand_tracking.py
```

### ✅ Unity Setup

1. Open Unity and create a new 3D project
2. Import `udpReceive`, `handTracking`, and `lineCode` scripts
3. Create 21 spheres under a `Hand` GameObject
4. Add `Manager` GameObject and attach scripts
5. Set port to `5052` to receive UDP data
